<h2>About Me 👨‍💻</h2>

I develop Cybersecurity solutions to safeguard digital landscapes and streamline manual processes through automation. 

I am currently an Information Security student at the National University of Singapore.

I have been awarded the Singapore Digital (SG:D) Scholarship by IMDA and CSA during my studies in Polytechnic and University. In addition, I was honoured to showcase my Diploma Final Year Project (FYP) with the National Cybersecurity R&D Lab (NUS-NCL) at Singapore International Cyber Week, GovWare Conference in 2018.
