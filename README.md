<h1>About Me 👨‍💻</h1>

I’m passionate in the power of digitization to streamline daily work processes while ensuring that Cybersecurity safeguards are put in-place. Being determined, I put in a lot of effort and hard work to achieve my goals.

Having graduated with a Diploma in Infocomm Security Management from Singapore Polytechnic, I’m grateful that I had opportunities to work on Cybersecurity projects and take part in Capture The Flag competitions with my friends. Being able to adapt to changes under challenging circumstances, I embarked on transformative efforts when I took on the role of a Leader for Events Management and Training in my school’s ambassadors team and department IC in Tengah Air Base Medical Centre.

Putting learning at the forefront, my Diploma Final-Year Project (FYP) team and I were honored to showcase our work with the National Cybersecurity R&D Lab (NUS-NCL) at Singapore International Cyber Week, GovWare Conference 2018. Aside, I have also worked on several web development and/or design projects for several of my clients.

Currently, I’m an Information Security student at the National University of Singapore, as well as a Content Manager of the N0H4TS Overseer’s Office by Division Zero. I’m also focused on honing my technical competencies to level my work-readiness.

Learn, unlearn and relearn. Keep learning.
